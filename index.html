    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="img/me.jpg" alt="Photo of Me" class="me"/>
    <p>If you reached this page you probably already know my name is Isabella Conti Americano Jordão de Magalhães.</p>
    <p>I am an advertising student at the University of Miami, class of 2016. My main focus in school is creative advertising, and working with graphic design is a passion of mine.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, but moved to the Cayman Islands in 2009, where I completed high school and lived until moving to Miami, FL in 2012.</p>
    <p>Advertising has always been of interest to me. My mother and grandfather have worked in this industry for many years, both giving me the grounds to build my career; it is a passion that runs in the Conti family!</p>
    <p>On this website you can see some of my proudest projects, as well as find my contact information and my resume. Feel free to contact me through any means that is most convenient to you.</p>
